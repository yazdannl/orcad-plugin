# Changelog

## 0.3.0 — Self-contained modern UI + Gridfinity

- UI reworked: 100% inline CSS (no framework CDN — Orca's WebView
  does not reliably load external stylesheets), dark-first theme adapting via
  `--orca-*` vars; only Monaco still uses CDN, with textarea fallback.
- Objects tab: searchable predefined-object dropdown (Box, Cylinder, Tube,
  Bracket, Gridfinity Bin, Gridfinity Baseplate) + styled sliders/checkboxes.
- New: spec-based Gridfinity Bin (42mm grid, 7mm units, stepped stacking foot,
  optional lip + 6x2 magnet holes) and Gridfinity Baseplate (sockets + magnets).
- Stateful defaults: Gridfinity Bin preselected; Gridfinity example in editor.
- int/bool parameter types with validation.

## 0.2.0 — Modern UI + always-on preview

- Bootstrap 5 UI (jsdelivr CDN, Orca `--orca-*` theme mapping, offline fallback).
- Left panel switches between Primitives and Code Editor tabs; single Run + Export acts on the active tab.
- Monaco code editor with plain-textarea fallback when the CDN is unreachable.
- Persistent 3D preview (dependency-free canvas renderer: orbit/zoom/spin/wireframe) fed by a decimated server-side tessellation payload; stats-only fallback.
- Exports unchanged (STL/STEP/3MF to plugin-local `exports/`).

## 0.1.0 — MVP

- Top-level CAD tab via `orca.pages.PagesPluginCapabilityBase` (FilamentHub-style).
- Parametric primitives: Box, Cylinder, Tube, Bracket-with-holes (sliders + validation).
- Code editor + 3 built-in examples, `result = ...` convention.
- Export STL (`export_stl`), STEP (`export_step`), 3MF (`Mesher`) to plugin-local `exports/`.
- Worker-thread exec, progress + result/error posts, audit-friendly paths.
- Script-capability fallback with upgrade message on builds lacking `orca.pages`.
